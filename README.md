# Nexperia
This is the PyTorch implementation of the Nexperia image classification models.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- PyTorch >= 1.0
- CUDA
- NumPy
- pandas

## Usage
### Standard training
The `main.py` contains training and evaluation functions in standard training setting.
#### Runnable scripts
- Training and evaluation using the default parameters
  
  We provide our training scripts in directory `scripts/`. For a concrete example, we can use the command as below to train the default model (i.e., ResNet50) on the Nexperia batch 2 or 3 dataset:
  ```bash
  $ bash scripts/nexperia/run_ce.sh [TRIAL_NAME]
  ```
  
  To train new Nexperia training set:
  ```bash
  $ bash scripts/nexperia/run_ce_train.sh [TRIAL_NAME]
  ```
  
  `ce` can be changed to `sat`, `fl`, `sat_fl`.
  
  To evaluate on Nexperia datasets from each month:
  ```bash
  $ bash scripts/nexperia/run_eval.sh [TRIAL_NAME]
  ```
  
  The argument `TRIAL_NAME` is optional, it helps us to identify different trials of the same experiments without modifying the training script. The evaluation is automatically performed when training is finished.
  
- Additional arguments include
  - `sat-es`: initial epochs of SAT
  - `sat-alpha`: the momentum term $\alpha$ of SAT
  - `mod`: modification of SAT, e.g., bad_1, bad_boost
  - `eli`: initial epochs of weighted CE for class i (from 1 to 10)
  - `ce-momentum`: the momentum term of weighted CE
  - `arch`: the architecture of backbone model, e.g., resnet50
  - `dataset`: the dataset to train, e.g., nexperia_split, nexperia, CIFAR10
